Logical Thinking
================

Mathematicians are in the business of stating things precisely. When you read a
mathematical statement, you are meant to take every word seriously; good
mathematical language conveys a clear, unambiguous message. In order to read
and write mathematics, you must practice the art of logical thinking. The goal
of this chapter is to help you communicate mathematically by understanding the
basics of logic.

A word of warning: mathematical logic can be difficultâ€”especially the first
time you see it. This chapter begins with the study of formal, or symbolic,
logic, and then applies this study to the language of mathematics. Expect
things to be a bit foggy at first, but eventually (we hope) the fog will clear.
When it does, mathematical statements will start making more sense to you.
